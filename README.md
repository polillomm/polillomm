### Welcome!

My name is Matheus and I'm a developer!<br>
I love learning new things through trial and error, to not only correct my own mistakes, but also learn from them.

**A few things about me:**<br>
👾 I love games<br>
👨‍💻 I like to spend time programming what comes to my mind<br>
🎥 For me, movies and series are more than a hobby <br>
💬 I love to talk, having a circle of friends is essential for me<br>
👨‍👩‍👦 I'm a family guy, they've always been the best part of me<br>
🐢 I have a tortoise, Tuty<br>

It's a great pleasure to meet you!
